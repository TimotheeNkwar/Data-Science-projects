##  project 1

### ðŸ§  **Laptop EDA with Python â€“ Project Summary**

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of laptops to uncover insights about **price, performance, brand trends, and hardware configurations**. Using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, the project explores key features such as:

- **Processor type, RAM, and storage**
- **Display size and resolution**
- **Brand-wise pricing**
- **Correlation between features and price**

The goal is to understand **what factors influence laptop prices**, detect **outliers or trends**, and prepare the dataset for further modeling (e.g. price prediction). Itâ€™s a great example of applying **data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering** on real-world tech product data.

## project 2

### ðŸ§  **Predicting Gender Based on Features â€“ Project Summary**

This project involves building a **machine learning model** to predict a person's **gender** based on features such as **height, weight, Age**, and other biometric traits. The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train classification models in Python.

#### âœ… Key steps:
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** with `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn`
- **EDA** using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to visualize feature distributions by gender
- **Feature selection** based on correlation with the target variable
- **Model training** with algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### ðŸŽ¯ Results:
- The best model achieved an **accuracy of ~89%** on the test set with the knn algorithm.
- Important features: **height**, **weight**, and **foot size**
- The model was evaluated using a **confusion matrix**, **precision**, and **recall**
