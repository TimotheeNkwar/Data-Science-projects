##  project 1

### ðŸ§  **Laptop EDA with Python â€“ Project Summary**

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of laptops to uncover insights about **price, performance, brand trends, and hardware configurations**. Using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, the project explores key features such as:

- **Processor type, RAM, and storage**
- **Display size and resolution**
- **Brand-wise pricing**
- **Correlation between features and price**

The goal is to understand **what factors influence laptop prices**, detect **outliers or trends**, and prepare the dataset for further modeling (e.g. price prediction). Itâ€™s a great example of applying **data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering** on real-world tech product data.

## project 2

### ðŸ§  **Predicting Gender Based on Features â€“ Project Summary**

This project involves building a **machine learning model** to predict a person's **gender** based on features such as **height, weight, Age**, and other biometric traits. The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train classification models in Python.

#### âœ… Key steps:
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** with `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn`
- **EDA** using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to visualize feature distributions by gender
- **Feature selection** based on correlation with the target variable
- **Model training** with algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
#### ðŸŽ¯ Results:
- The best model achieved an **accuracy of ~89%** on the test set with the knn algorithm.
- Important features: **height**, **weight**, and **Age**
- The model was evaluated using a **confusion matrix**, **precision**, and **recall**

## project 3
### ðŸ§  Outlier Detection & Removal â€“ IQR (InterQuartile Range) Method

A data cleaning project aimed at detecting and removing outliers from a dataset using the IQR method.  
This technique identifies extreme values based on the interquartile range and eliminates them to improve data quality.

- Calculated Q1 and Q3 to find the IQR (Q3 âˆ’ Q1)
- Identified outliers outside the range \[Q1 âˆ’ 1.5Ã—IQR, Q3 + 1.5Ã—IQR\]
- Removed outliers to obtain a cleaner dataset
- Applied on real or simulated data with optional visualization (e.g., boxplot)


## project 4

### ðŸ§  EDA on Crime in the USA

A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on understanding crime patterns and trends across the United States. This project involves the analysis of various aspects of crime data, including weapon usage, crime hotspots, and victim demographics.

#### Key Features:
- **Top 5 Weapons Used in Crimes**: Identified and visualized the most commonly used weapons in crimes.
- **Areas with the Most Crimes**: Analyzed crime distribution across states/cities to highlight crime hotspots.
- **Crosstab of Age Group and Victim Sex**: Explored the relationship between victim age groups and sex, uncovering demographic trends in victimization.

  ## Project 5

### ðŸ§  Online Sales Data â€“ EDA & Insights

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an online sales dataset to uncover trends in customer behavior, sales performance, product popularity, and seasonality. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing, inventory, and revenue strategies.

## project 6

### ðŸ§  Credit Card Fraud Detection â€“ Project Summary

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning classification algorithms. The dataset contains real transaction data, with features engineered from customer behavior and anonymized for privacy. Given the high class imbalance (few fraud cases), the project places special emphasis on data preprocessing and evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

ðŸ”§ Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Class inbalanced 

## project 7 

### ðŸ§  Cutsomer Segmentation

This project uses unsupervised learning (K-Means) to segment customers based on features like
annual income and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to support
targeted marketing strategies, supported by interactive visualizations.
