### ðŸ§  **Laptop EDA with Python â€“ Project Summary**

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of laptops to uncover insights about **price, performance, brand trends, and hardware configurations**. Using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, the project explores key features such as:

- **Processor type, RAM, and storage**
- **Display size and resolution**
- **Brand-wise pricing**
- **Correlation between features and price**

The goal is to understand **what factors influence laptop prices**, detect **outliers or trends**, and prepare the dataset for further modeling (e.g. price prediction). Itâ€™s a great example of applying **data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering** on real-world tech product data.
